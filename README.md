# Create-comp163-assignment-5
2025 freshman in COMP 163 - 010 assignment-5 (Loop Mastery)

For challenge 1, I used a while loop so that the program would continue for as long as it needed for the sequence to be completed.
For challenge 2, I used a for loop because I knew there needed to be a range for the code to run.
For challenge 3, I also used a for loop because, unlike with challenge two, I knew the exact range and that it needed to be a range.

The first solution that I needed help on, I used ChatGPT for help, but didn't get an answer that would work, so I asked the teacher, and I ended up going based on his work to finally use an if/else statement in the challenge! to help with all the possibilities.
Solution 2 was adding the is_prime variable to make the code run smoother.
I mainly used ChatGPT to help understand how to complete the multiplication in the table.

Minor AI helps to boost and explain program problems.
